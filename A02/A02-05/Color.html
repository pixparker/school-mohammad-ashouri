            An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
            In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:
#rrggbb
Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
        </p>
       <p class="p4">
        In CSS, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:
        hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
        Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

        Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
        
        Lightness is also a percentage. 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white
