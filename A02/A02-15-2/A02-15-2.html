                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of 
                presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate 
                .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the 
                <span style=text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:double;text-decoration-color:blue;>.css file to be cached to improve 
                the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting</span>. Separation of formatting and content also makes 
                it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, 
                by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate 
                formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

                In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers 
                to use and share documents. 
                <span style="text-decoration-line: underline;text-decoration-style: wavy;text-decoration-color: red;text-decoration-thickness: 4px;">1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee 
                specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990</span>. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer 
                Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his 
                personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first 
                entry.The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet 
                by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. 
                Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup 
                Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4
