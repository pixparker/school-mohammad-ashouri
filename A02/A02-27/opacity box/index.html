                <p>
                    Opacity is the measure of impenetrability to electromagnetic or other kinds of radiation, especially visible light. 
                    In radiative transfer, it describes the absorption and scattering of radiation in a medium, such as a plasma, 
                    dielectric, shielding material, glass, etc. An opaque object is neither transparent (allowing all light to pass through) 
                    nor translucent (allowing some light to pass through). When light strikes an interface between two substances, 
                    in general some may be reflected, some absorbed, some scattered, and the rest transmitted (also see refraction). 
                    Reflection can be diffuse, for example light reflecting off a white wall, or specular, for example light reflecting 
                    off a mirror.
