            <h1>Mechanics</h1>
            <p>
                Most mechanics specialize in a particular field, such as auto body mechanics, air conditioning and refrigeration mechanics, 
                auto mechanics, bicycle mechanics, boiler mechanics, race car mechanics, aircraft mechanics, and other areas.
                A mechanic is typically certified by a trade association or regional government power. Mechanics may be separated into 
                two classes based on the type of machines they work on, heavyweight and lightweight. Heavyweight work is on larger 
                machines or heavy equipment, such as tractors and trailers, while lightweight work is on smaller items, such as 
                automotive engines.
