        <h1>Sky</h1>
        <p>
            The sky is an unobstructed view upward from the surface of the Earth. It includes the atmosphere and outer space. 
            It may also be considered a place between the ground and outer space, thus distinct from outer space.
            In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere. This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the 
            Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting. The celestial sphere is conventionally divided 
            into designated areas called constellations.
